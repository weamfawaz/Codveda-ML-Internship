# Task 2: Simple Linear Regression

## Objective
Build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices using a single feature.

## Dataset
- **Name:** House Prediction Dataset (Boston Housing Dataset)
- **Target Variable:** PRICE
- **Feature Used:** RM (Average number of rooms per dwelling)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Preprocessed the data  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Trained a Linear Regression model  
5. Evaluated the model using MSE and R² score  
6. Visualized actual vs predicted values  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Results
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Calculated  
- R² Score: Evaluated  

## Conclusion
The model shows a positive linear relationship between the number of rooms and house prices, demonstrating the effectiveness of simple linear regression for continuous value prediction.
