# Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at Codveda Technologies.

## 📌 Task Description
The goal of this task is to preprocess a raw dataset and prepare it for machine learning models.

## 📂 Dataset
- Iris Dataset (`iris.csv`)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps
- Loaded the dataset and explored its structure
