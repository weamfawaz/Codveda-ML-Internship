# Task 1: Logistic Regression for Binary Classification

## Objective
The objective of this task is to implement a Logistic Regression model to predict binary outcomes using a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset  
- **Source:** Scikit-learn built-in dataset  
- **Target Variable:** Diagnosis  
  - 0 = Malignant  
  - 1 = Benign  

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Preprocessed the data by scaling numerical features  
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn  
5. Interpreted model coefficients  
6. Evaluated the model using:
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - ROC Curve and AUC score  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Results
- The Logistic Regression model achieved high classification accuracy.
- The ROC curve showed strong model performance with a high AUC value.
- Feature coefficients helped identify the most influential variables in prediction.

## Conclusion
Logistic Regression proved to be an effective model for binary classification on the Breast Cancer dataset, demonstrating strong predictive performance and interpretability.
