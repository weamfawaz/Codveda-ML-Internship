# Task 2: Decision Trees for Classification

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a Decision Tree classifier to predict a categorical outcome and understand how decision trees make predictions.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Source:** Scikit-learn built-in dataset  
- **Target Variable:** Species of flowers  
  - Setosa  
  - Versicolor  
  - Virginica  

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the Iris dataset  
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
3. Trained a Decision Tree classifier on labeled data  
4. Visualized the decision tree structure  
5. Applied pruning techniques (max depth) to reduce overfitting  
6. Evaluated the model using:
   - Accuracy score  
   - F1-score  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Results
- The Decision Tree classifier achieved high accuracy on the Iris dataset.
- Tree visualization helped in understanding feature-based decision making.
- Pruning improved generalization and reduced overfitting.

## Conclusion
Decision Trees are powerful and interpretable models for classification tasks. By applying pruning techniques, the model achieved better performance and avoided overfitting.
